    "# Introduction\n",
    "Light is what we see when the retina converts photons into spikes. Odors are what we smell when volatilised molecules are converted into spikes. Touch is what we feel when nerve endings turn tactile pressure into spikes. The brain trades in the global currency of the *spike*. \n",
    "\n",
    "If our end goal is to build a spiking neural network (SNN), it makes sense to use spikes at the input too. Although it is quite common to use non-spiking inputs (as will be seen in Tutorial 3), part of the appeal of encoding data come from the *three S's*: spikes, sparsity, and static suppression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **Spikes**: (a-b) Biological neurons process and communicate via spikes, which are electrical impulses of approximately 100 mV in amplitude. (c) Many computational models of neurons simplify this voltage burst to a discrete, single-bit event: a '1' or a '0'. This is far simpler to represent in hardware than a high precision value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   **Sparsity**: (c) Neurons spend most of their time at rest, silencing most activations to *zero* at any given time. Not only are sparse vectors/tensors (with loads of zeros) cheap to store, but say we need to multiply sparse activations with synaptic weights. If most values are multiplied by '0', then we don't need to read many of the network parameters from memory. This means neuromorphic hardware can be extremely efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.   **Static-Suppression (a.k.a, event-driven processing**: (d-e) The sensory periphery only processes information when there is new information to process. Each pixel in (e) responds to *changes* in illuminance, so most of the image is blocked out. Conventional signal processing requires all channels/pixels to adhere to a global sampling/shutter rate, which slows down how frequently sensing can take place. Event-driven processing now only contributes to sparsity and power-efficiency by blocking unchanging input, but it often allows for much faster processing speeds.\n",

    "#### 2.2.3 Summary of Rate Coding\n",
    "The idea of rate coding is actually quite controversial. Although we are fairly confident rate coding takes place at our sensory periphery, we are not convinced that the cortex globally encodes information as spike rates. A couple of compelling reasons why include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Power Consumption:** Nature optimised for efficiency. Multiple spikes are needed to achieve any sort of task, and each spike consumes power. In fact, [Olshausen and Field's work in \"What is the other 85% of V1 doing?\"](http://www.rctn.org/bruno/papers/V1-chapter.pdf) demonstrates that rate-coding can only explain, at most, the activity of 15% of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1). It is unlikely to be the only mechanism within the brain, which is both resource-constrained and highly efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Reaction Response Times:** We know that the reaction time of a human is roughly around 250ms. If the average firing rate of a neuron in the human brain is on the order of 10Hz, then we can only process about 2 spikes within our reaction timescale.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why, then, might we use rate codes if they are not optimal for power efficiency or latency? Even if our brain doesn't process data as a rate, we are fairly sure that our biological sensors do. The power/latency disadvantages are partially offset by showing huge noise robustness: it's fine if some of the spikes fail to generate, because there will be plenty more where they came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you may have heard of the [Hebbian mantra of \"neurons that fire together, wire together\"](https://doi.org/10.2307/1418888). If there is plenty of spiking, this may suggest there is plenty of learning. In some cases where training SNNs proves to be challenging, encouraging more firing via a rate code is one possible solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate coding is almost certainly working in conjunction with other encoding schemes in the brain. We will consider these other encoding mechanisms in the following sections. \n",
    "This covers the `spikegen.rate` function. Further information [can be found in the documentation here](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snntorch.spikegen.html).\n",

    "Temporal codes capture information about the precise firing time of neurons; a single spike carries much more meaning than in rate codes which rely on firing frequency. While this opens up more susceptibility to noise, it can also decrease the power consumed by the hardware running SNN algorithms by orders of magnitude. \n",

The question then becomes: *for a given input current (and equivalently, input feature), how long does it take for a spike to be generated?*\n",

    "### 2.4 Delta Modulation\n",
    "There are theories that the retina is adaptive: it will only process information when there is something new to process. If there is no change in your field of view, then your photoreceptor cells are  less prone to firing. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is to say: **biology is event-driven**. Neurons thrive on change.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a nifty example, a few researchers have dedicated their lives to designing retina-inspired image sensors, for example, the [Dynamic Vision Sensor](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7128412/). Although [the attached link is from over a decade ago, the work in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eOM15U_t1M&ab_channel=TobiDelbruck) was ahead of its time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta modulation is based on event-driven spiking. The `snntorch.delta` function accepts a time-series tensor as input. It takes the difference between each subsequent feature across all time steps. By default, if the difference is both *positive* and *greater than the threshold $V_{thr}$*, a spike is generated:\n",
