    "Spikes are a type of nonlinearity that can also be used to learn more complex regression tasks. \n",
    "But if spiking neurons only emit spikes that are represented with 1's and 0's, then how might we perform regression? I'm glad you asked! Here are a few ideas:\n",

    "* Use the total number of spikes (a rate-based code)\n",
    "* Use the time of the spike (a temporal/latency-based code)\n",
    "* Use the distance between pairs of spikes (i.e., using the interspike interval)\n",

    "\n",
    "> Note: is it cheating to directly access the membrane potential, i.e., something that is meant to be a 'hidden state'? At this time, there isn't much consensus in the neuromorphic community. Despite being a high precision variable in many models (and thus computationally expensive), the membrane potential is commonly used in loss functions as it is a more 'continuous' variable compared to discrete time steps or spike counts. While it costs more in terms of power and latency to operate on higher-precision values, the impact might be minor if you have a small output layer, or if the output does not need to be scaled by weights. It really is a task-specific and hardware-specific question. "
