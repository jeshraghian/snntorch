        "A large variety of neuron models are out there, ranging from biophysically accurate models (i.e., the Hodgkin-Huxley models) to the extremely simple artificial neuron that pervades all facets of modern deep learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Models**$-$While biophysical models can reproduce electrophysiological results with a high degree of accuracy, their complexity makes them difficult to use at present.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Artificial Neuron Model**$-$On the other end of the spectrum is the artificial neuron. The inputs are multiplied by their corresponding weights and passed through an activation function. This simplification has enabled deep learning researchers to perform incredible feats in computer vision, natural language processing, and many other machine learning-domain tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Models**$-$Somewhere in the middle of the divide lies the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model. It takes the sum of weighted inputs, much like the artificial neuron. But rather than passing it directly to an activation function, it will integrate the input over time with a leakage, much like an RC circuit. If the integrated value exceeds a threshold, then the LIF neuron will emit a voltage spike. The LIF neuron abstracts away the shape and profile of the output spike; it is simply treated as a discrete event. As a result, information is not stored within the spike, but rather the timing (or frequency) of spikes. Simple spiking neuron models have produced much insight into the neural code, memory, network dynamics, and more recently, deep learning. The LIF neuron sits in the sweet spot between biological plausibility and practicality. \n",

This sharp drop of membrane potential promotes a reduction of spike generation, which supplements part of the theory on how brains are so power efficient. Biologically, this drop of membrane potential is known as 'hyperpolarization'. Following that, it is momentarily more difficult to elicit another spike from the neuron. Here, we use a reset mechanism to model hyperpolarization.\n",
