In my own experiments, I have yet to find a case where the Alpha neuron outperforms the Synaptic and Leaky neuron models. It seems as though learning through a positive and negative exponential only makes the gradient calculation process more difficult, and offsets any potential benefits in more complex neuronal dynamics.\n",
